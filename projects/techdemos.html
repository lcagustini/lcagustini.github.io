    <h1 class="title workbench-regular text-center">Per object pixelation</h1>

    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/result-gif.gif" alt="">
    <p>
        A stencil based post-processing effect that gives specific objects in a scene a pixelated look, without needing special materials or rendering the whole game at a lower resolution.
        <br>
        <br>
        As an example of how this was done, we have this source scene, which is rendered normally up until the post-processing step
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/source.png" alt="">
    <p>
        Every object that will be pixelated writes to the stencil buffer during the render process, which means at the end of the rendering pipeline, we get a mask of these objects in the frame, including depth testing and culling
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/stencil.png" alt="">
    <p>
        This mask is then downscaled together with the color buffer, which will pixelate all objects, and give us an image source to overlay on top of the original frame
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/color-pixel.png" alt="">
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/stencil-pixel.png" alt="">
    <p>
        The original stencil mask is then added to this pixel mask, this is done to get the silhouette of the object to be very sharp. If we didn't do this, we would end up with a round cut of the pixelated color buffer, which would look out of place
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/mask.png" alt="">
    <p>
        Now, with this mask done and the pixelated color buffer, we can apply this mask to it and overlay the result on top of the camera buffer
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/result.png" alt="">
    <p>
        After this we can post-process and tone map as usual, giving us the final frame
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/pixelate/result-final.png" alt="">

    <h1 class="title workbench-regular text-center">Depth of Field</h1>
    
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/result-gif.gif" alt="">
    <p>
        A post-processing effect that blurs the image based on a focal plane and distances from this plane, known as a circle of confusion, which simulates the effect of a camera with a wide aperture
        <br>
        <br>
        To show how this effect works, we start with this source render
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/source.png" alt="">
    <p>
        This scene produces the following depth buffer during render
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/depth.png" alt="">
    <p>
        From this depth buffer, we can take our desired focal plane and get which fragments should be considered background, which should be foreground, and which are in focus
        <br>
        With this we can build a buffer where then red and green channels store this information
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/circle-of-confusion.png" alt="">
    <p>
        We want to separate the background from the rest of the image and blur them separately, this is so the foreground can bleed into the background when blurred, but not the other way around
        <br>
        To do this, we create a mask by generating a mask from the background channel of the circle of confusion
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/mask.png" alt="">
    <p>
        And storing it as the blue channel, creating a buffer with all the supporting data that we need to render the effect
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/coc-mask.png" alt="">
    <p>
        With this buffer done, we can apply the mask to the camera source to get a background only buffer
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/bg.png" alt="">
    <p>
        That we can then blur separately
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/bg-blur.png" alt="">
    <p>
        Now we can blur everything. This will be the source for the foreground blur later
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/blur.png" alt="">
    <p>
        Finally, we can take the circle of confusion red and green channels to interpolate between the three buffers we have, the blurred background, blurred whole image, and the original camera source
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="../img/dof/result.png" alt="">
    <p>
        With the effect done, the rendering can continue normally and we get a final result that mimics a camera shallow depth of field
    </p>

    <h1 class="title workbench-regular text-center">Simple Parallax</h1>
    <img class="center screenshot" src="../img/parallax/simple.gif" alt="">
    <p>
        A parallax effect is achieved by insetting the uvs of a quad by the view direction in tangent space
        <br>
        This makes the shader sample the texture as if the quad was push back, giving the artist the power to make materials that look like it has multiples transparent planes on top of each other, but is actually a simple opaque quad
    </p>

    <h1 class="title workbench-regular text-center">Interior Mapping Parallax</h1>
    <img class="center screenshot" src="../img/parallax/interior.gif" alt="">
    <p>
        An extension of this parallax effect is done by projecting the quad uvs into a virtual cube along the view direction, then using this projection as uvs for a cubemap
        <br>
        This effect is used to simulate interiors and holes without the need for geometry, which greatly increases the amount of rooms that can be rendered
    </p>
